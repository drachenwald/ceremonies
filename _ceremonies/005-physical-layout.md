Not all courts have to involve the Monarchs in being seated. These can be far more fluid in conduct and set up. for a more formal court:
* Placing the entire retinue behind the thrones is to be discouraged.
* The herald should be able to move freely: to centre stage as voice, into the background, to interact with the Monarchs and to guide those called into the royal presence.
* Guards and champions should be where they can physically do their job.
* Attendants need easy access to provide drinks, refills, snacks and paraphernalia to the Crown.
* An ideal court would have a chronicler, although this has been rarely done. If you know something complicated or freestyle may occur, a chronicler is recommended. They will need a table and a chair.
* The Crown may need a table for drinks and items. A table is needed for tokens and other objects to be held until they are needed. The herald should have a table for a drink and other items required for court.
* There should be corridors to allow the nobles access to the Crown as commanded. If the Crown intends to process in or out, make sure that corridor is large enough for the retinue.
* You will need enough space for those called forwards. If this is likely to be a large number, such as prior to a vigil or for an elevation, take this into account.
* A stool and/or cushon should be provided for kneeling in front of the Crown. Keep a spare chair available for any who may be unable to kneel. A chair is also handy for elevation ceremonies for the candidate, however fit.
* Other royalty invited to attend in state should be arranged from the thrones of the Crown, those closest being higher in precedence. Remember that those who rule the lands for their Majesties, such as Princes or Barons, jump up the order in their own lands.
* Ideally the peerage should be sat closest to the Crown, either in the front rows or in choirs to the side. Peers are as easy to herd as cats, so this will rarely be achieved to perfection.
