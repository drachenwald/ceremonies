* Not all courts have to involved the Sovereigns in being seated. These can be far more fluid in conduct and set up. for a more formal court:
* Placing the entire retinue behind the thrones is to be discouraged.
* The herald should be in position to move freely: to centre stage as voice, into the background, to interact with the Sovereigns and to guide those called into the royal presence.
* Guards and champions should be where they can physically do their job.
* Attendants need easy access to provide drinks, refills, snacks and paraphenalia to the Sovereigns.
* An ideal court would have a chronicler, although this has been rarely done. If you know something complicated or freestyle may occur, a chronicler is recommended. They will need a table and chair.
* The Sovereigns will need a table for their drinks and stuff. A table will be needed for tokens and other objects to be held until they are needed. The herald should have a table for a drink and other items required for court.
* There should be corridors to allow the nobles access to their Sovereigns as commanded. If the Sovereigns intend to process in ot out, make sure that corridor is large enough for the retinue.
* You will need enough space for those called forwards. If this is likely to be a large number, such as prior to a vigil or for an elevation, take this into account.
* A stool and/or cushon should be provided for kneeling in front of the Sovereigns. Keep a spare chair handy for any who may be unable to kneel. A chair is also handy for elevation ceremonies for the candidate, however fit.
* Other royalty invited to attend in state should be arranged from the Sovereigns, those cloest being higher in precedence. Remember that those who rule the lands for their Majesties, such as Princes or Barons, jump up the order in their own lands.
* Ideally the peerage should be sat closest to the Sovereigns, either in the front rows or in choirs to the side. Peers are as easy to herd as cats, so this will rarely be achieved to perfection.
