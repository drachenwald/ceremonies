title: 1. Invocation to the Crown Lists
---

Herald
: Their Royal Majesties command the presence of all entrants in the Crown Lists, that they should present themselves and their consorts before the Crown.

: _Couples approach the thrones one at a time, exchange a few words with the Crown, receive usually some token of the day, withdraw slightly and kneel._

Herald
: My Lords and Ladies, you know well that true gentles enter combat not for their own personal glory, but rather to advance the honour of their consorts; and to prove, by their courtesy and valour upon the field, their worthiness of that honour.

: Be mindful, as you fight, of your consort's honour as well as your own, for your consort personifies all honour and loyalty, beauty and truth â€“ they embody the love that is worthy of great reward.

: Therefore, today you fight in the Crown Lists not to gain power for yourself, not for your own glory and honour, as you may in other lists. You fight instead for the honour and glory of the one whose favour you bear upon the field, whom you would advance by your valour, skill and courtesy.

: And should victory be granted to you this day, you will be crowned together as the Heirs of Drachenwald, until the day of your coronation shall come.

Sovereign
: You have heard the reasons for our lists. Each of you here today has an inspiration whose favour you would advance, whom you would crown this day as your consort. Is it still your desire to participate in these lists?

Entrants
: It is.

Consort
: Do each of you, entrant and consort, now affirm that you fulfil all the qualifications for fighting today as set forth by our laws?

Entrants and Consorts
: I do.

Sovereign
: And do you all here know the Rules of the Lists and swear to abide them?

Entrants
: I do.

Consort
: Then bear your favours bravely into battle, and prove the worth and virtue of your consorts, whether in victory or in honourable defeat. You have our leave to withdraw and prepare.
