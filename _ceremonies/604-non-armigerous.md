title: 4. Non-Armigerous Awards

For all these awards, after the recipients are called to the court, the Crown may address them. After this, the herald reads a scroll, if there is one, and the Crown hands the recipient the scroll or a token. While the recipient retires from the presence, the herald calls for vivats.
